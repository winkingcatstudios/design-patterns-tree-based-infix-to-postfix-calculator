# tree-based-infix-to-postfix-calculator
Tree based infix to postfix calculator demonstrating the Command, Abstract Factory, Wrapper Facade software design patterns

A basic expression evaluator using a Stack and Infix to Postfix algorithm. To improve the design it uses the Command Pattern to evaluate the Postfix expression,
and the Abstract Factory to create the commands based on parsing the Infix expression to convert it to a Postfix expression.
